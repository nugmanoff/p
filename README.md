## About

This tool is literally a manager of managers (recursion :yay:). It allows you to deal with configurations of Cocoa package managers more easily.

## Installation

### Using Homebrew
```
$ brew install crococoders/homebrew-tap/p
```
### Installing from source
Check out a copy of the this repository. Then, either add the bin directory to your $PATH, or run the provided install.sh.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nugmanoff/p.git
$ cd p
$ make install # or you can run sudo ./install.sh directly
```
Note that you may need to be prompted for password if you do not have permission to write to the `/usr/local`.
